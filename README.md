## Overview
- As the project's foundation, I used the repository [Django-Styleguide-Example](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide-Example/tree/master), which I obtained from Hacksoft's style guide, and removed everything I considered unnecessary.
- La configuraci√≥n de Django (settings) se encuentra en config.django.base.
- For security, I used JSON Web Tokens (JWT). when creating a user or logging in, I add a token to the response cookies. It has an expiration time that can be configured with an environment variable (JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA_SECONDS).
- All models stores Django model state on every create/update/delete.
